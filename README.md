# Gopher Market
This full stack web application is an online marketplace specifically designed for University of Minnesota Twin Cities students.
Users are able to browse and filter through items as well as sell their own items on the site.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, EJS

- Developed a RESTful Full Stack Web Application with user authentication, allowing University of Minnesota students to buy and sell items online
- Engineered a highly scalable Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, utilizing MongoDB for efficient and organized data management, building a foundation for future scaling and maintenance.
- Implemented a comprehensive search and filtering functionality, enabling users to find items based on price, category, and location while also incorporating a convenient starring feature for saved favorites.
- Leveraged the capabilities of JavaScript's asynchronous functions and promises to streamline and optimize CRUD operations.

## Optimizations

Some future tweaks if time allows:
- Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need for database queries and improving performance.
- Implement pagination for displaying large result sets, allowing users to navigate through pages rather than loading all data at once. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the server.
- Utilize client-side rendering frameworks like React or Vue.js to shift some of the rendering responsibilities to the client-side, reducing the load on the server and improving perceived performance.

## Lessons Learned:

I discovered the power of building a scalable MVC architecture with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and the satisfaction of implementing features like user authentication, search and filtering functionality, and asynchronous operations using JavaScript.
Through the countless hours of reading through documentation, I learned that patience is key when learning new languages and technologies.
